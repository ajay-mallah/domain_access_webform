# Domain Webform Access

The Domain Webform Access module allows you to restrict access to webforms and
their submissions based on assigned domains. It automatically assigns the active
domain to forms and submissions at the time of their creation or submission.
Additionally, it provides an extra filter for both forms and submissions.

For a full description of the module, visit the
[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/domain_webform_access).
